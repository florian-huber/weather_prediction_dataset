# Weather prediction dataset
## A dataset for teaching machine learning and deep learning

Hands-on teaching of modern machine learning and deep learning techniques heavily relies on the use of well-suited datasets. 
The "weather prediction dataset" is a novel tabular dataset that was specifically created for teaching machine learning and deep learning to an academic audience.
The dataset contains intuitively accessible weather observations from 18 locations in Europe. It was designed to be suitable for a large variety of different training goals, many of which are not easily giving way to unrealistically high prediction accuracy. Teachers or instructors thus can chose the difficulty of the training goals and thereby match it with the respective learner audience or lesson objective. 
We provide examples of possible training tasks that could be covered with the dataset (see the Jupyter notebooks in `\notebooks\` for the used Python code). 
The compact size and complexity of the dataset makes it possible to quickly train common machine learning and deep learning models on a standard laptop so that it can used in live hands-on sessions.

The dataset can be found in the `\dataset\` folder in this repository or can be downloaded from zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7053722

The dataset was presented at the "Teaching Machine Learning" workshop at ECML 2022: https://teaching-ml.github.io/2022/
