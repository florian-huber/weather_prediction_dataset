Weather prediction dataset

Dataset created for machine learning and deep learning training and teaching purposes.
Can for instance be used for classification, regression, and forecasting tasks.
Complex enough to demonstrate realistic issues such as overfitting and unbalanced data, while still remaining intuitively accessible.

Data collection selection and processing
----------

The initial meteorological data was retrieved from ECA&D [1] a project that makes available daily 
observations at meteorological stations throughout Europe and the Mediterranean. 18 different European 
cities or places were selected of which multiple daily observations were available through the 
years 2000 to 2010. Those where Basel (Switzerland), Budapest (Hungary), Dresden, Düsseldorf, 
Kassel, München (all  Germany), De Bilt and Maastricht (the Netherlands), Heathrow (UK), Ljubljana (Slovenia), 
Malmo and Stockholm (Sweden), Montélimar, Perpignan and Tours (France), Oslo (Norway), Roma (Italy), and 
Sonnblick (Austria). 

Recordings of daily meteorological observations for these 18 locations span different times, some contain 
collections that go back to the 19th century. Here, however, we only selected the time span from 
2000 to 2010 resulting in 3654 daily observations. The dataset is then constructed from all data of 
those 18 locations.

The data in addition consists of different observations. While all selected locations provide data 
for the variables ‘mean temperature’, ‘max temperature’, and ‘min temperature’, we also included 
data for the variables 'cloud_cover', 'wind_speed', 'wind_gust', 'humidity', 'pressure', 'global_radiation', 
'precipitation', 'sunshine' wherever those were available. 

After collecting the data, very basic cleaning of the data was performed. Columns with > 5% invalid 
entries (“-9999”) were removed, columns with <= 5% invalid entries where kept but invalid entries 
were replaced by mean values. This resulted in 165 variables (or features) over the course of 3654 days.
Finally, we transformed several data units to achieve more similar ranges of the present values. 
This makes the data more suitable to be used for machine learning or deep learning even without 
additional processing. We deliberately did not chose to fully standardize the data because we 
wanted to keep the presented units and values as intuitively accessible as possible. Temperature are 
now given in degree Celsius, wind speed and gust in m/s, humidity in fraction of 100%, sea level 
pressure in 1000 hPa, global radiation in 100 W/m2, precipitation amounts in centimeter, sunshine in hours.
